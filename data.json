  	"description": "It is a piece of work about the miracles of nature. Because existence is reasonable, so we take every creature as resources for granted. But actually they are the multiplication of countless miracles of an extrenely slow process. This is a miracle of seeing a whale due to the moire effect of the two wood pieces when there is no human interference. The ambition of rotating the installation of human being's would make the miracle imperceptionable.",

  	"description": "“The second first impression” is a project that created for the “100 day in the making” class. For the last one hundred days I dyed, tore, sewed, glued, folded and did various manipulations on existing images. The images were from magazines and vintage postcards I found on flea markets. I wanted to recycle an existing image - take it as is - manipulate it - and through that, given it a new meaning. The creation process is never final, we can keep creating from previous creations. I hope someone will take this project and recycle it as well.",

The project is inspired by the collision and contradictory development of human civilization, technology, and natural elements in present society. Artistically depicting a virtual parallel era in which most of human civilization has been annihilated, nature and the ruins of technology become the center of the world.",
